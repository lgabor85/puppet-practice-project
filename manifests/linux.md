It uses an `unless` statement to check if the hostname of the current host matches a pattern that includes "smtp". This is done using the `$facts['networking']['hostname']` variable, which contains the hostname of the current host, and a regular expression `/^.*smtp.*/`. If the hostname does not match this pattern, the code inside the `unless` block is executed.

Within the `unless` block, the `lookup` function is used to retrieve the value of the `general::smtpserver` key from the Puppet data hierarchy. This value is assigned to the `$relayserver` variable. The `lookup` function allows for flexible and centralized management of configuration data, as the actual SMTP server can be specified in a Hiera data file or another data source.

Next, the `postfix` class is declared to configure the Postfix mail server. The `postfix` class is instantiated with several parameters:
- `mydomain` is set to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the current host, retrieved from `$facts['networking']['fqdn']`.
- `smtp_relay` is set to `false`, indicating that SMTP relay is not enabled.
- `relay_host` is set to the value of `$relayserver`, enclosed in square brackets to indicate that it is a relay host.

This configuration ensures that the Postfix mail server is properly set up for non-SMTP servers, using the specified relay server for outgoing mail.

```puppet
# Configure mailserver for non-smtp servers
  unless $facts['networking']['hostname'] =~ /^.*smtp.*/ {
    $relayserver = lookup('general::smtpserver')
    class { 'postfix':
      mydomain   => $facts['networking']['fqdn'],
      smtp_relay => false,
      relay_host => "[${relayserver}]",
    }
  }
```

This specific section uses a `case` statement to handle different operating system families. The `case` statement evaluates the value of `$facts['os']['family']`, which contains the family of the operating system (e.g., Debian, RedHat).

In this snippet, the code checks if the operating system family is 'Debian'. If it is, the code block inside the 'Debian' case is executed. Within this block, the `ntp` class is declared. The `ntp` class is responsible for configuring Network Time Protocol (NTP) services on the host, ensuring that the system time is synchronized with NTP servers.

The `servers` parameter of the `ntp` class is set using the `lookup` function, which retrieves the value of the `ntp::servers` key from the Puppet data hierarchy. This allows for flexible and centralized management of NTP server configurations, as the actual NTP servers can be specified in a Hiera data file or another data source. By using the `lookup` function, the configuration can be easily adjusted without modifying the Puppet code directly.

```puppet
case $facts['os']['family'] {
  'Debian': {
    class { 'ntp':
      servers => lookup('ntp::servers'),
    }
```
