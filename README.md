# Puppet Practice Project

## Overview
This project is designed to provide a structured environment for practicing Puppet configurations and reverse engineering existing Puppet code, specifically focusing on a Linux profile.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose:

- **manifests/**: Contains the main Puppet manifests.
  - **init.pp**: Entry point for the Puppet configuration.
  - **linux.pp**: Contains the Linux profile code managing various configurations and services for Linux hosts.

- **modules/**: Contains custom Puppet modules.
  - **profile/**: A module for managing profile-specific configurations.
    - **manifests/**: Contains manifests for the profile module.
      - **init.pp**: Initializes the profile module.
      - **linux.pp**: Placeholder for Linux-specific configurations.
    - **templates/**: Contains EPP templates.
      - **example.epp**: An example of an Embedded Puppet template.

- **hieradata/**: Contains Hiera data files.
  - **common.yaml**: Common data for Hiera, managing configuration data.

- **environment.conf**: Configures the Puppet environment, specifying module paths and environment-specific settings.

- **Puppetfile**: Manages module dependencies for the Puppet project.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Use the Puppetfile to install required modules.
3. **Run Puppet**: Execute Puppet to apply the configurations defined in the manifests.

## Usage
This project can be used to practice Puppet coding, understand the structure of Puppet modules, and learn how to manage configurations for Linux hosts effectively.
